              This choropleth map displays the fatal road crash rates across
              Australian states and territories in 2023. Darker shades indicate
              higher death rates per 100,000 people. The Northern Territory and
              Queensland record the highest rates, reflecting extensive rural
              networks and higher speed zones.

              The boxplot compares posted speed limits at fatal crash sites
              across states. The Northern Territory and South Australia show
              wider spreads, reflecting mixed urban–rural road conditions, while
              Victoria and Tasmania concentrate around mid-range speeds,
              suggesting crashes occur primarily in controlled speed
              environments.

              The area chart reveals a major long-term decline in both single-
              and multi-vehicle fatal crashes since the early 1990s. However,
              single-vehicle crashes remain proportionally persistent, showing
              that driver behaviour factors—fatigue, distraction, or
              impairment—continue to dominate fatality risks despite overall
              safety gains.

            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              The line chart illustrates how both fatal crashes and total deaths
              rose steadily until 2022 before showing a slight decline in 2023.
              The consistent gap between the two lines indicates that
              multi-fatality incidents contribute heavily to total deaths,
              emphasizing the importance of reducing not just crash frequency,
              but also crash severity.

              This heatmap reveals distinct temporal patterns in crash
              fatalities. Friday and Saturday show the darkest cells, marking
              peak risk periods often linked to late-night travel, social
              activities, and fatigue. In contrast, Monday to Wednesday remain
              relatively low, indicating predictable weekly rhythms useful for
              targeted enforcement strategies.

          This faceted area plot visualizes how crash frequencies fluctuate by
          hour across different days. Late evening peaks, particularly on
          weekends, suggest heightened vulnerability during periods of reduced
          visibility and increased driver fatigue. These insights can guide
          scheduling for patrol and public safety campaigns.
